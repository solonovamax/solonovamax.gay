## About Me

I'm an 18-year-old dev from Quebec, Canada.
I believe open source code is very important for a healthy developer ecosystem,
as well as just for promoting transparency.
The large majority of my time doing programming is spent contributing to open source projects.
I frequently contribute to many projects and am always looking to do more for the open source community!

The rest of my time is spent either on my school work or social media.
Currently, I am pursuing Computer Science.
I'm hoping to get a degree in it before continuing on into the industry. I don't have a clear idea of what I plan on doing, other than that
I want to do programming. I will probably do whatever seems the most interesting at the time.
